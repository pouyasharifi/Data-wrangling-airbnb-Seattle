# Data Wrangling in Pandas Using Seattle Airbnb Data

In this project, I take a deep look at Seattle Airbnb data to address some of the business questions as well as practice data wrangling in pandas, which might be of use for people practicing data science coding interview in pandas.

## Questions answered:
I addressed these business questions in Seattle airbnb data.
* Variations in price, price per accommodate, number of Airbnb listings, and property type across different neighborhoods of Seattle.
* How much discount you should expect (or negotiate) from the owner if you book a place for a week or a month?
* How do the listing availability and prices change throughout the year? (availability and price trends).

## Installation

To run the code completely in the jupyter notebook, you need to install a few libraries using either pip or conda (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, geopandas, and shapely).
```
pip install numpy
pip install geopandas
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
```
